the function of this glorious macropad is to just have all my kanye related shortcuts on one macropad so that i can hopefully manifest the old kanye again


features: 

not much but i got a cool oled display!
also i have 8 keys and a rotary encoder

Everything in the cad model fits together with hopes and dreams, im gonna make a decent model as soon as i get the pcb my current one sucks

its also made in onshape (the greatest website of all time)

anyways heres the schematic:
